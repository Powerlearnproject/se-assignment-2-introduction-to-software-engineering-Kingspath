# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

ANSWER: Software engineering is a broader discipline that encompasses the entire software development cycle, from initial concept and design to testing, deployment and maintenance, applying engineering principles to create software that is reliable, efficient, maintainable and scalable. Traditional programming on the other hand focuses primarily on writing code to solve specific problems.
Example: A software engineer might design and develop software to manage and optimise network infrastructure.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

ANSWER: The SDLC is a structured framework that outlines the process of software creation. It consists of several phases, each with specific goals and deliverables. Some common SDLC phases are:

1. PLANNING AND REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS: This phase involves defining the project scope, gathering requirements from stakeholders and creating a project plan.
2. DESIGN: In this phase, the software architecture is designed, including system design, user interface design and database design.
3. DEVELPOMENT: This phase focuses on writing the actual code based on the design specifications.
4. TESTING: Good quality testing is performed to identify and fix bugs and to ensure the software meets predefined requirements.
5. DEPLOYMENT: The software is released to clients or end-users, internally within the organization or externally to the public.
6. MAINTENANCE: Once deployed, the software is monitored, updated and fixed as needed to address bugs and incorporate new features.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

ANSWER: Agile and Waterfall are two contrasting approaches to software development.

Waterfall: Follows a linear, sequential process. Requirements are gathered upfront, followed by design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is complete. Waterfall is preferred in scenarios wherein requirements are clearly defined and there are strict deadlines and regulations guiding the SDLC.
Example: building a large-scale enterprise system where requirements are well-defined, and regulatory compliance is critical.

Agile: Follows an iterative and incremental approach. Software is developed bit by bit, with continuous feedback and adaptation. It is well suited for projects with evolving requirements or where user input is crucial. Agile is preferred in scenarios wherein the project is complex with unclear requirements. Project has a faster time-to-market deadline and requires adaptation to changing needs.
Example: Developing a mobile app with changing user needs, where regular updates and responsiveness are crucial.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

ANSWER: Requirements engineering is the foundation of successful software development. It's the process of gathering, analysing, documenting and managing the needs and expectationms of stakeholders. Key phases include:

1. ELICITATION: Client is interviewed to identify their needs and expectations.
2. ANALYSIS: Requirements are reviewed for clarity, consistency and feasibility.
3. SPECIFICATION: Documented requirements are created as a blueprint for development.
4. VALIDATION: Client confirms that the documented requirements accurately reflect their needs.
5. MANAGEMENT: Requirements are tracked and updated.

Effective requirements engineering is essential throughout the SDLC, it helps in creating a focused development process, better resource allocation and a higher quality end product.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
